The portfolio I created was based on user flow. I placed multiple contact me buttons on the page, so the user feels very in touch when reding my content and services. Some challenges I faced while creating this portfolio was creating a media query for buttons when the screen sizes enlarge. I overcame this by finding a button size that worked for all screen sizes. Everything else was very straight forward because boot strap is great to use and navigate. While creating this web portfolio I was amazed that my project was now 90% HTML and 10% CSS. Compared to past projects boot strap has simplified life and helped me tremendously.

Resources I used where:
-Bootstrap
-iconmnstr
-google fonts
